    <td>Max, Hans, and Rosa I cannot account for, but I know that Liesel

		Meminger was thinking that if the bombs ever landed on Himmel

		Street, not only did Max have less chance of survival than

		everyone else, but he would die completely alone.</td>

    <td>383</td> 

    <td><u>Liesel is unconcerned about the property  above-ground, but, 

		rather Max's well-being, as where everyone else, is most likely 

		concerned with replaceable items/property.</u> <i> The <b>

		dramatic irony</b> is that we latter learn that Liesel is the 

		sole survivor in the same place Max would have been, suggesting 

		that Max would have survived, provided he was in the basement, 

		and not trying to look at the sky. </i> [C]On the morning of 

		March 1, 2017, I was in my basement, but it latter occurred to me,

		that it was safer than being on the school bus like I would have 

		normally been at this time.</td>

    <td>"Liesel calculated that there were four more reading sessions like

		that with Frau Holtzapfel before the Jews were marched through

		Molching. They were going to Dachau, to concentrate. <i>That makes

		two weeks</i>, she would later write in the basement. <i>Two weeks to

		change the world, and fourteen days to ruin it.</i>"</td>

    <td>388</td> 

    <td>[E]<u>Liesel sounds like she's aware what "concentrat"ing is, and she's

		trying to either ignore the fact, or keep her mind off of it,</u> <i>

		the use of <b>repetition</b>, of redefining the same measure of time,

		in a different measure of time gives an emphasis to the meaning.<i/></td>

    <td>"Hans was sent first, quite ironically, to Stuttgart, and later,

		to Essen. He was given one of the most undesirable positions on

		the home front. The LSE.<br/>

		<br/><center><b>***A NECESSARY EXPLANATION***<br/>

		LSE<br/>

		Luftwaffe Sondereinheit—<br/>

		Air Raid Special Unit</b></center><br/>

		The job of the LSE was to remain aboveground during air raids and

		put out fires, prop up the walls of buildings, and rescue anyone

		who had been trapped during the raid. As Hans soon discovered,

		there was also an alternative definition for the acronym. The men

		in the unit would explain to him on his first day that it really

		stood for <i>Leichensammler Einheit</i>— Dead Body Collectors. When he

		arrived, Hans could only guess what those men had done to deserve

		such a task, and in turn, they wondered the same of him. Their

		leader, Sergeant Boris Schipper, asked him straight out. When Hans

		explained the bread, the Jews, and the whip, the round-faced

		sergeant gave out a short spurt of laughter. 'You’re lucky to be

		alive.' His eyes were also round and he was constantly wiping them.

		They were either tired or itchy or full of smoke and dust. 'Just

		remember that the enemy here is not in front of you.'"</td>

    <td>431</td> 

    <td>[C]<u>This seems to be the kind of work that people would volunteer for,

		helping others, and recovering damaged property, such as the Red Cross,

		or the Boy Scouts of America which <i>was</i> based off Hitler Youth,

		yet neither organisation seems to be helping, and it was stated to be,

		"one of the most undesirable positions on the home front" of the war</u>

		[E]Up until this point Hans has been portrayed as the type of character

		who would be willing to help others in a job such as the LSE but he seems

		to be considering this a punishment, rather than a chance to help others.</td>

    <td>"Rudy simply continued walking and spoke through the cold air in

		front of him. Close to Tommy Müller’s apartment block, he said, 'You

		know something, Liesel, I was thinking. You’re not a thief at all,'

		and he didn’t give her a chance to reply. 'That woman lets you in. She

		even leaves you cookies, for Christ’s sake. I don’t call that stealing.

		Stealing is what the army does.  Taking your father, and mine.' He kicked

		a stone and it clanged against a gate. He walked faster. 'All those rich

		Nazis up there, on Grande Strasse, Gelb Strasse, Heide Strasse.' Liesel

		could concentrate on nothing but keeping up. They’d already passed Frau

		Diller’s and were well onto Munich Street. 'Rudy—'<br/>

		'How does it feel, anyway?'<br/>

		'How does what feel?'<br/>

		'When you take one of those books?'<br/>

		At that moment, she chose to keep still. If he wanted an answer, he’d

		have to come back, and he did.<br/>

		'Well?' But again, it was Rudy who answered, before Liesel could even

		open her mouth.<br/>

		'It feels good, doesn’t it? To steal something back.'"</td>

    <td>482</td> 

    <td>[R]Aside from perhaps <i>The Whistler</i>, being technically in her possession

		for a brief moment, Liesel did not steal anything 'back'.  [E]Rudy however,

		resorting to theft when ever he is feeling bad, or a lack of control, may be a

		kleptomaniac.  Then again, it may just be <u>man's natural desire to take stuff,

		“No crime in wanting a little more,” as quoted by Viktor Chemmel(Pg. 276).</u> 

		<i>Markus Zusak did a nice job of utilising one-sided <b>dialogue</b> without

		excluding Liesel’s <b>POV</b></i></td>

    <td>"Within twenty meters, Rudy stopped. Just as I arrived myself, I noticed

		him standing there, recovering his breath… The growing crowd was assembling

		behind them, their breath and sentences sticking to Liesel’s back. “Well,”

		said Rudy, “should we take a look?” He stepped through the remainder of trees

		to where the body of the plane was fixed to the ground. Its nose was in the

		running water and the wings were left crookedly behind. Rudy circled slowly,

		from the tail and around to the right. “There’s glass,” he said. “The

		windshield is everywhere.” Then he saw the body. Rudy Steiner had never seen

		a face so pale. “Don’t come, Liesel.” But Liesel came. She could see the barely

		conscious face of the enemy pilot as the tall trees watched and the river ran.

		The plane let out a few more coughs and the head inside tilted from left to right.

		He said something they obviously could not understand. “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,”

		Rudy whispered. “He’s alive.” The toolbox bumped the side of the plane and brought

		with it the sound of more human voices and feet. The glow of fire was gone and

		the morning was still and black. Only the smoke was in its way, but it, too,

		would soon be exhausted… The eyes were like coffee stains, and gashes were ruled

		across his cheeks and chin. A ruffled uniform sat, unruly, across his chest.

		Despite Rudy’s advice, Liesel came even closer, and I can promise you that we

		recognized each other at that exact moment. I know you, I thought. There was a

		train and a coughing boy. There was snow and a distraught girl. You’ve grown, I

		thought, but I recognize you. She did not back away or try to fight me, but I know

		that something told the girl I was there. Could she smell my breath? Could she hear

		my cursed circular heartbeat, revolving like the crime it is in my deathly chest? I

		don’t know, but she knew me and she looked me in my face and she did not look away.

		As the sky began to charcoal toward light, we both moved on. We both observed the boy

		as he reached into his toolbox again and searched through some picture frames to pull

		out a small, stuffed yellow toy. Carefully, he climbed to the dying man. He placed the

		smiling teddy bear cautiously onto the pilot’s shoulder. The tip of its ear touched

		his throat. The dying man breathed it in. He spoke. In English, he said, “Thank you.”

		His straight-line straight-line cuts opened as he spoke, and a small drop of blood

		rolled crookedly down his throat. “What?” Rudy asked him. “Was hast du gesagt? What

		did you say?” Unfortunately, I beat him to the answer. The time was there and I was

		reaching into the cockpit. I slowly extracted the pilot’s soul from his ruffled uniform

		and rescued him from the broken plane. The crowd played with the silence as I made my

		way through."</td>

    <td>489</td> 

    <td><u>Rudy seems to have done a complete 180º, at the beginning of the book, he would have

		been intrigued by the site, but rather than leaving a Teddy Bear, would have likely looked

		for any spare supplies or food the pilot may have.  He now appears to be feeling bad for the

		person who just bombed a nearby town in Germany, to the point that he places a Teddy Bear on

		him, despite being his sister's Teddy Bear she probably does not know he took, that the pilot

		then thanks him for, in a foreign language, he did not understand.</u> <i> Furthermore, the 

		clear <b>juxtaposition</b> of a dying pilot with, "gashes were ruled across his cheeks and

		chin." and "A ruffled uniform[sitting], unruly, across his chest" to a happy "small, stuffed

		yellow toy", "smiling teddy bear" that has been "cautiously" placed on his shoulder, is a nice

		addition for further impact on the pilot’s condition. </i> [R]This is also a strong callback to

		the prologue, (Pg 10) where this very scene is breifly described as one of the three times Death

		has seen Liesel.</td>
