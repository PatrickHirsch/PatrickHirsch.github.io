Ch01|A long long time ago                                    |6 |A long long time ago
   v|I can still remember how                                |7 |I can still remember how
   v|That music used to make me smile                        |8 |A dumb ram would have made me smile
Ch02|And I knew if I had my chance                           |8 |And I knew I alone exist
   v|That I could make those people dance                    |8 |
   v|And maybe they'd be happy for a while                   |10|And if I had died, I would not be missed
   v|But February made me shiver                             |9 |
Ch--|With every paper I'd deliver                            |9 |
Ch--|Bad news on the doorstep                                |6 |
Ch--|I couldn't take one more step                           |6 |
Ch--|I can't remember if I cried                             |8 |
Ch--|When I read about his widowed bride                     |9 |
Ch--|Something touched me deep inside                        |7 |
Ch12|The day the music died                                  |6 |
   v|So                                                      |1 |
   v|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye    |12|
Ch--|Singin' this'll be the day that I die                   |9 |
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch--|Did you write the book of love                          |7 |
Ch--|And do you have faith in God above                      |9 |
Ch--|If the Bible tells you so?                              |7 |
Ch--|Do you believe in rock and roll?                        |8 |
Ch--|Can music save your mortal soul?                        |8 |
Ch--|And can you teach me how to dance real slow?            |11|
Ch--|Well, I know that you're in love with him               |9 |
Ch--|'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym                     |8 |
Ch--|You both kicked off your shoes                          |6 |
Ch--|Man, I dig those rhythm and blues                       |7 |
Ch--|I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck                    |10|
Ch--|With a pink carnation and a pickup truck                |11|
Ch--|But I knew I was out of luck                            |8 |
Ch--|The day the music died                                  |6 |
Ch--|I started singin'                                       |5 |
Ch--|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye    |12|
Ch--|Singin' this'll be the day that I die                   |9 |
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch--|Now, for ten years we've been on our own                |9 |
Ch--|And moss grows fat on a rolling stone                   |9 |
Ch--|But, that's not how it used to be                       |8 |
Ch--|When the jester sang for the king and queen             |10|
Ch--|In a coat he borrowed from James Dean                   |9 |
Ch--|And a voice that came from you and me                   |9 |
Ch--|Oh and while the king was looking down                  |9 |
Ch--|The jester stole his thorny crown                       |8 |
Ch--|The courtroom was adjourned                             |6 |
Ch--|No verdict was returned                                 |6 |
Ch--|And while Lennon read a book on Marx                    |9 |
Ch--|The quartet practiced in the park                       |8 |
Ch--|And we sang dirges in the dark                          |8 |
Ch--|The day the music died                                  |6 |
Ch--|We were singin'                                         |4 |
Ch--|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye        |11|
Ch--|And singin' this'll be the day that I die               |10|
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch--|Helter skelter in a summer swelter                      |10|
Ch--|The birds flew off with a fallout shelter               |10|
Ch--|Eight miles high and falling fast                       |7 |
Ch--|It landed foul on the grass                             |7 |
Ch--|The players tried for a forward pass                    |9 |
Ch--|With the jester on the sidelines in a cast              |11|
Ch--|Now the half-time air was sweet perfume                 |9 |
Ch--|While sergeants played a marching tune                  |8 |
Ch--|We all got up to dance                                  |6 |
Ch--|Oh, but we never got the chance                         |8 |
Ch--|'Cause the players tried to take the field              |8 |
Ch--|The marching band refused to yield                      |8 |
Ch--|Do you recall what was revealed                         |8 |
Ch--|The day the music died?                                 |6 |
Ch--|We started singin'                                      |5 |
Ch--|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye        |11|
Ch--|And singin' this'll be the day that I die               |10|
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch--|Oh, and there we were all in one place                  |9 |
Ch--|A generation lost in space                              |8 |
Ch--|With no time left to start again                        |8 |
Ch--|So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick                |10|
Ch--|Jack Flash sat on a candlestick                         |8 |
Ch--|'Cause fire is the devil's only friend                  |8 |
Ch--|Oh and as I watched him on the stage                    |9 |
Ch--|My hands were clenched in fists of rage                 |8 |
Ch--|No angel born in Hell                                   |6 |
Ch--|Could break that Satan's spell                          |6 |
Ch--|And as the flames climbed high into the night           |10|
Ch--|To light the sacrificial rite                           |8 |
Ch12|I saw Satan laughing with delight                       |9 |This hero's laughing with delight
   v|The day the music died                                  |6 |The day this 'monster' dies
   v|He was singin'                                          |4 |Now I am singin'
   v|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye        |11|
Ch--|Singin' this'll be the day that I die                   |9 |
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch--|I met a girl who sang the blues                         |8 |
Ch--|And I asked her for some happy news                     |9 |
Ch--|But she just smiled and turned away                     |8 |
Ch--|I went down to the sacred store                         |8 |
Ch--|Where I'd heard the music years before                  |9 |
Ch--|But the man there said the music wouldn't play          |10|
Ch--|And in the streets the children screamed                |8 |
Ch--|The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed                 |9 |
Ch--|But not a word was spoken                               |7 |
Ch--|The church bells all were broken                        |7 |
Ch--|And the three men I admire most                         |8 |
Ch--|The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost                     |9 |
Ch--|They caught the last train for the coast                |8 |
Ch--|The day the music died                                  |6 |
Ch--|And they were singing                                   |5 |And they'll be singing
Ch--|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay the monster's been killed
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye    |12|
Ch--|Singin' this'll be the day that I die                   |9 |
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch--|They were singing                                       |4 |They'll be singing
Ch--|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay the monster's been killed
