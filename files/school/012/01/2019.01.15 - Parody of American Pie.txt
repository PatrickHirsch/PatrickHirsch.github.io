Ch12|A long long time ago                                    |06|A long long time ago
   v|I can still remember how                                |07|I can still remember how
   v|That music used to make me smile                        |08|A dumb ram would have made me smile
Ch 2|And I knew if I had my chance                           |08|And I knew I alone exist
v   |That I could make those people dance                    |08|If I died, I would not be missed
v   |And maybe they'd be happy for a while                   |10|And I got stuck in a rock for a while
v   |But February made me shiver                             |09|But the bull made me shiver
v   |With every paper I'd deliver                            |09|With the great blow he did deliver
v   |Bad news on the doorstep                                |06|Humans I would soon see,
v   |I couldn't take one more step                           |06|After I climbed a tree,
v   |I can't remember if I cried                             |08|I can't remember if I cried
v   |When I read about his widowed bride                     |09|When they threw an axe at my numb thigh
Ch12|Something touched me deep inside                        |07|Now I've meet this Geatish guy,
v   |The day the music died                                  |06|On this day, I will die
v   |So                                                      |01|So
v   |Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |08|Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch 4|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|I Heard the Shaper's song coming from Herot's great halls
v   |And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye    |12|Of Cain and Able's ancient feud, and on me evil falls
v   |Singin' this'll be the day that I die                   |09|Thinkin' must I be the villian?
v   |This'll be the day that I die                           |07|Must I be the villian?
v   |Did you write the book of love                          |07|Am I a hero's overture?
Ch 5|And do you have faith in God above                      |09|I asked someone who can see the future;
v   |If the Bible tells you so?                              |07|The dragon sitting on gold
v   |Do you believe in rock and roll?                        |08|He just handed me some sunblock
v   |Can music save your mortal soul?                        |08|And that said I am the Dane's mold
v   |And can you teach me how to dance real slow?            |11|I asked him what he ment by Nihilism
v   |Well, I know that you're in love with him               |9 |Well, I know you're a primitive being
v   |'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym                     |8 |But I'll try to explain what I mean
v   |You both kicked off your shoes                          |6 |He shifted on his gold,
v   |Man, I dig those rhythm and blues                       |7 |Man, destiny's been foretold
v   |I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck                    |10|
v   |With a pink carnation and a pickup truck                |11|
Ch--|But I knew I was out of luck                            |8 |But still I did not understand
Ch--|The day the music died                                  |6 |This is the day, I die,
Ch--|I started singin'                                       |5 |I started singin'
Ch--|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye    |12|
Ch--|Singin' this'll be the day that I die                   |9 |
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch--|Now, for ten years we've been on our own                |9 |
Ch--|And moss grows fat on a rolling stone                   |9 |
Ch--|But, that's not how it used to be                       |8 |
Ch--|When the jester sang for the king and queen             |10|
Ch--|In a coat he borrowed from James Dean                   |9 |
Ch--|And a voice that came from you and me                   |9 |
Ch--|Oh and while the king was looking down                  |9 |
Ch--|The jester stole his thorny crown                       |8 |
Ch--|The courtroom was adjourned                             |6 |
Ch--|No verdict was returned                                 |6 |
Ch--|And while Lennon read a book on Marx                    |9 |
Ch--|The quartet practiced in the park                       |8 |
Ch--|And we sang dirges in the dark                          |8 |
Ch--|The day the music died                                  |6 |
Ch--|We were singin'                                         |4 |I'm singin'
Ch--|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye        |11|
Ch--|And singin' this'll be the day that I die               |10|
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch--|Helter skelter in a summer swelter                      |10|
Ch--|The birds flew off with a fallout shelter               |10|
Ch--|Eight miles high and falling fast                       |7 |
Ch--|It landed foul on the grass                             |7 |
Ch--|The players tried for a forward pass                    |9 |
Ch--|With the jester on the sidelines in a cast              |11|
Ch--|Now the half-time air was sweet perfume                 |9 |
Ch--|While sergeants played a marching tune                  |8 |
Ch--|We all got up to dance                                  |6 |
Ch--|Oh, but we never got the chance                         |8 |
Ch--|'Cause the players tried to take the field              |8 |
Ch--|The marching band refused to yield                      |8 |
Ch--|Do you recall what was revealed                         |8 |
Ch--|The day the music died?                                 |6 |
Ch--|We started singin'                                      |5 |
Ch--|Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye        |11|
Ch--|And singin' this'll be the day that I die               |10|
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |
Ch12|Oh, and there we were all in one place                  |9 |Stuck between a hero and a hard place,
v   |A generation lost in space                              |8 |	-ace
v   |With no time left to start again                        |8 |
v   |So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick                |10|	-olf
v   |Jack Flash sat on a candlestick                         |8 |As he roared, "I am Beowulf"
v   |'Cause fire is the devil's only friend                  |8 |I ate one of his friends
v   |Oh and as I watched him on the stage                    |9 |As he grabbed my {left,right} appendage
v   |My hands were clenched in fists of rage                 |8 |His hands were clenched in a fist of rage
v   |No angel born in Hell                                   |6 |I thoght no weapon at all,
v   |Could break that Satan's spell                          |6 |Could break that Dragon's spell
v   |And as the flames climbed high into the night           |10|But as the blood spewed from my painful side,
v   |To light the sacrificial rite                           |8 |

v   |The day the music died                                  |6 |The day this 'monster' dies
v   |He was singin'                                          |4 |Now I am singin'
v   |Bye, bye Miss American Pie                              |8 |Hoor,-ay for the hardness of walls
Ch--|Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry       |14|
Ch--|Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye        |11|
Ch--|Singin' this'll be the day that I die                   |9 |I know, this'll be the day that I die
Ch--|This'll be the day that I die                           |7 |This'll be the day that I die
Ch--|I met a girl who sang the blues                         |8 |
Ch--|And I asked her for some happy news                     |9 |
Ch--|But she just smiled and turned away                     |8 |
Ch--|I went down to the sacred store                         |8 |
Ch--|Where I'd heard the music years before                  |9 |
Ch--|But the man there said the music wouldn't play          |10|
Ch--|And in the streets the children screamed                |8 |
Ch--|The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed                 |9 |
Ch--|But not a word was spoken                               |7 |
Ch--|The church bells all were broken                        |7 |
Ch--|And the three men I admire most                         |8 |
