	While yes, I too agree in regards to the positives of "more prisons being constructedâ€¦ to accommodate the increasing [number of] inmate[s]", I also believe this point is nullified by the fact that this isn't their goal when constructing these prisons.&nbsp This point is evidenced by the presence of "minimum occupancy clauses" in contracts between states and private prison companies, requiring the state to keep prisons relatively full, or pay a large fee, incentivising states to keep the prison populations high.&nbsp As for your closing remark, "Private prisons take away the power of the federal government in the justice system," while not familiar with the rights delegated between the state and the company, I would assume that the state has a high level of control over how the prison is managed, for example the news report's narrator mentions that "GEO was able to grant [them] access within a week", but only after obtaining approval from the state.

	I feel the report's interviews showed the private prison industry in a mostly positive light, not surprising given the majority of the interviews were with the owners and executives of CoreCivic & GEO Group.&nbsp Some currently incarcerated prisoners were given interviews, also depicting the industry in a mostly positive light, but no context was given as to how these interviewees were chosen, one can only assume a pre-interview-screening was conducted by the company.
	<br>Regarding your 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph, I assume you mean giving an option to join a program, rather than incarceration in hopes of leading to rehabilitation with the goal of keeping prisons less crowded.&nbsp While I like the idea, and feel it would be much more effective than traditional incarceration, however, would likely be much less cost effective, in direct opposition to the reasoning behind the adoption of the private prison system.

	Surprisingly I've never even considered the difference in the training between the guards in each institution, but it does make sense that the government would have more rigorous training than a company such as CoreCivic & GEO Group.&nbsp I assume the training for a government employed prison guard's would be on-par with a police officer, as where a private prison guard's training would likely be done cheaply by cutting corners based of other aspects of their business practices.&nbsp While this could be risking safety of both inmates and guards, it could also be the reasoning behind the disproportionate lengthened sentences resulting from guards being ill-equipped to handle situations that arise.

	While I don't believe the government is above greed, temptation, or corruption either, I feel the primary difference is that regardless of who is managing a prison, the government (or at least the taxpayers) will have to pay more money the more inmates it is housing.&nbsp The contrast that makes your point valid is that when a privatized prison will <i>be</i> payed more money the more inmates it is housing.
	<br>Although not the Supreme Court, court systems are in some cases handled in the private sector, but not quite legally binding and usually just an agreement to settle outside of court and do what is decided upon in the pseudo-court.&nbsp Yes, a technicality, I know, but an interesting parallel nonetheless.
