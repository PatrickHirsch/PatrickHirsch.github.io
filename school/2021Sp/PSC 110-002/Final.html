<hr>1. How does Plato's idea of the philosopher compare to Whitman's idea of the poet? How does each relate back to the people?
<div class="post">

		Walt Whitman, "The Poet" of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> refers to himself as "God," the only way he is capable of seeing the world, is as it is for him.&nbsp; Knowing nothing of the world before his birth, he can not see it as anything but a preface to his world with the sole purposes of preparing his world for his birth, the time after his death; not relevant to him, thus he cannot possibly see it of anything of any importance.&nbsp; To Whitman, his presence must be what makes something "real," because he cannot possibly comprehend what he cannot see, he cannot see how he could take it to be real.

		Plato's idea of the philosopher differs greatly, his teacher and basis for much of his work, Socrates, recognized he knew nothing and saw it as his job to question everything, and force others to question everything.&nbsp; Rather than believing all that he sees is all that is, believes there to be a greater "world of forms" more real than what he sees.&nbsp; The Philosopher must accept ignorance, not take anything at face value, always questioning what he sees, and recognize the possibility there is more than the 3D shadows we can see on the allegorical cave wall making up the reality we know.

<hr>2. How do Morrison and McCarthy incorporate violence into their visions of American politics? 
<div class="post">
	<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Spacer.gif" class="tab">
		Morrison's <i>Beloved</i> tells the story of Sethe, a former Slave who's past & present are defined heavily by acts of violence.&nbsp; The major defining traumatic events defining her life are the violent assault by "the schoolteacher"'s nephews who, most significantly as she recounts this event, stole her milk, being a slave, Sethe was seen as property and as such this assault would not necessarily have been illegal as she would not have been protected by the law, and this violent attack is made legally possible by American politics of the time.&nbsp; Furthermore, this attack traumatized her so much that she killed her daughter, Beloved, an extreme act of violence she sees as preferable to subjecting her to the politics of America at the time, both amid slavery and even after being "freed," perhaps even suggesting violence can sometimes be justified, in this case in the face of what is deemed to be a worse violence.

	<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Spacer.gif" class="tab">
		McCarthy's <i>Blood Meridian</i> is a quite violent book, as is its partial inspiration, <i>Moby Dick</i> echoing how in real-life "violence is everywhere" and posing questions regarding the meaning of violence, can it be justified, can it be avoided.&nbsp; Violence is, as McCarthy observes, the US's solution to many problems admits a time of rapid change leaving to unrest and uncertainty due to a variety of ongoing factors.&nbsp; Given the freshly concluded Mexican-American War for instance, the Child at one point joins Captain White's group of Filibusters to "ransack" land the political borders of which had yet to be defined in a post-war era, this violence justified by America's benevolent duty under Manifest Destiny to colonize the whole continent on account of their being more fit to govern than the Mexicans or the natives.&nbsp; The Child's reason for partaking in these violent acts is rather simply need for food and does not see the benevolence of these actions or how he is helping to liberate anyone.

		The Judge however is skilled at persuasion, manipulating parties to get to a resolution of sorts circumventing the use of physical violence, America, as with most countries will admits war or conflict attempt to negotiate a resolution through peaceful compromise, naturally, if avoidable, neither side will want to compromise, both sides want their terms reached while making the other side believe it has gotten the better end of this bargain.

<hr>3. Explain how Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin of Inequality attempts to explain human unhappiness and anxiety.
<div class="post">
	<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Spacer.gif" class="tab">
		Rousseau's <i>Discourse on the Origin of Inequality</i> tells of a possible history in which society could have been developed in the manner it had been, who must have made the decisions that shaped modern society, and for whom were these decisions intended to benefit.&nbsp; Rousseau does not actually intend to provide a factually accurate account of how society came to be, but regather uses this history formed of conjecture to illustrate to the reader absurdity of the decisions governing our world that we have come to accept as normal.

	<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Spacer.gif" class="tab">
		A specific example provided is the ownership of land, the idea that one person can own land and anything that grows upon it could not have occurred naturally and must have been made by the first person to lay claim to a large fertile plot of land for that's the only person this dynamic benefits.&nbsp; The landowner highers people to put in the work to grow food on his land, which he can then sell back to them and others in need of food making everyone dependent on the landowner.&nbsp; A more natural system would be the food grown would "owned" by whoever puts in the work to produce it rather than whoever arbitrarily "owns" the land it's grown on.

<!--hr>1. Using at least three course texts, explain how these texts build a philosophy or a political theory out of the management or control of desire (or, if they refuse to manage/control desire, why they choose that route). Why is desire or want such an important political concept?
